ANSWER.

In a decentralized Monopoly game, i think all transactions and information would be securely stored on the blockchain without the need for a centralized server. The game would be open to everyone, ensuring transparency and accessibility.

Key functionalities would include tracking player positions and property ownership, recording transactions, and enforcing game rules to maintain fairness.

To prevent cheating, advanced technology would be employed to prevent players from spending beyond their means and to ensure that random events like dice rolls are tamper-proof. Transparency would be maintained so that all players can verify the integrity of the game.
